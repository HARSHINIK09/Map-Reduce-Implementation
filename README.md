# Map-Reduce-Implementation
Implemented the Map/Reduce function pair, map-reduce task scheduler and failure handler in Golang.

Implemented a worker process, that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a master process, that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers.
